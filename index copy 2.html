            <p>As a steelmaking company, was lacking a comprehensive course that educates company employees on the process of steel production. This gap particularly affects non-technical staff, such as those in HR, Procurement, Communication, Finance, IT, and similar departments. It is essential for all employees, regardless of their role, to understand how steel is made and the various processes involved in our steel plant, from mining to the final product.</p>

          <div class="col-md-6 mb-5">
            <p>To address this problem, I have created a comprehensive eLearning course to educate employees about the steelmaking production route. This course covers the entire steelmaking process, including the fundamentals of steelmaking, its applications, and the detailed steps involved. By completing this course, employees will gain a thorough understanding of the integrated steel production processes used in our plant, from the start (mining) to the finish (steel).</p>

              <h2 class="title text-primary">Action Mapping</h2>
              <p>I began by action mapping the problem to pinpoint the essential knowledge required for individuals to help the company achieve its goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2030. By concentrating on what the learner needs to know, we can build more effective information and drive meaningful behavioral change. Identifying these specific actions is particularly crucial for a goal focused on developing technical skills.</p>

      <div class="container">
     
        <h2 class="title text-primary">Text-based Storyboard</h2>
<p>After finalizing the high-priority actions, I designed a storyboard with a particular focus on gamification levels for the learner to complete, and wrote a simple script for these levels. Upon completing each level, the learner earns a chance to spin a wheel to receive interesting fun facts about steelmaking. Allowing the user to spin the wheel up to four times to receive four different fun facts enhances the learning experience. I also wrote the visualisation-based script detailing the actions performed in each slide.</p>

<div class="container">
     
  <h2 class="title text-primary">Visual Mockups</h2>
    <p>Once I received approval on the storyboard, I moved forward to visual design. I used PowerPoint to create a mood board and style guide, as well as the wireframes and high-fidelity mockups. I incorporated the GFGâ€™s brand colors into the style guide and chose a font that would complement the tone of the project.

      From there, I created wireframes to get a sense of the formatting for each type of slide (title, gamification, question, Character style, etc). This allowed me to smoothly transition into designing high-fidelity mockups. This was a significant and exciting part of the process, as it allowed me to get a feel for what the project would look like. After receiving feedback from team and implementing some formatting and visual iterations, I felt confident in the visual design and moved forward to prototyping.  </p>

<div class="container">
     
  <h2 class="title text-primary">Interactive Prototype</h2>
  <p>I developed an interactive prototype to gather feedback on the project's functionality before fully developing it. This part was especially exciting for me because I wanted to ensure that, upon completing each level, users would have the opportunity to spin the wheel. The prototype included a title slide, introduction, meeting STELA (the character), the spin-the-wheel moment, question 1, and the consequences for correct and incorrect choices.

    Using Adobe Character Animator, I carefully crafted each scene, adjusting the characters' movements and expressions to align with the story's tone. This required precise timing and developing multiple scenes in Character Animator and Adobe After Effects to be transferred into a single slide in Articulate Storyline 360.
    
    In Storyline, I concentrated on the design and triggers for each level's completion. This involved adding hover states to buttons and using fade transitions between scenes for a polished effect.
    
    Additionally, I used Adobe Illustrator to create customized graphics and icons, including steelmaking icons and the spin-the-wheel graphic. Also I have used doodly video for video animations, then collected all the icons, graphics and videos and integrated them into Articulate Storyline 360, where I could appropriately place them on the layers.</p>

<h2 class="title text-primary">Results & Takeaways</h2>

<br>
<h7 class="title text-primary mb-3">Consistency across design elements is essential</h7> especially when creating an inclusive and diverse experience. From the start, I wanted to create characters and select graphics appealing to various backgrounds and identities. To this end, it was difficult to find graphics that were visually and stylistically consistent. This required me to create and adapt graphics and images to create the uniformity I needed from an instructional design perspective without compromising any of the valuable DEI components.
<br>
<br>
<h7 class="title text-primary mb-3">Invest time and a detail-oriented mindset in the planning and design phase </h7>Invest time and a detail-oriented mindset in the planning and design phase to save time and effort in the development phase. The old adage: measure twice, cut once, speaks volumes in this instance.
<br>
<br>
<h7 class="title text-primary mb-3">Lead with curiosity. </h7> Continuing to learn, solve problems, and staying curious are crucial skills I have honed in my past professional experience that I was able to leverage in this line of work. From navigating deep dives with SMEs and understanding complex business needs to learning new technology and staying up-to-date with changing instructional design trends and AI developments, maintaining a growth mindset is key.</p>
